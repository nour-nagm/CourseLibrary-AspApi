# CourseLibrary
My practice on **Building a RESTful API with ASP.NET Core 3** and **Implementing Advanced RESTful Concerns with ASP.NET Core 3** courses on Pluralsight (both authored by **Kevin Dockx**). Here, we follow the case of courses library for pirates (authors) and their courses where we interact with the API to get info (with constraints or not), add more authors/courses, update their details, and deleting them if we want.

- The first course covers fundamental REST APIs goals and topics i.e. **interacting with our API** and be concerned with **idempotency** and **method safety**, **validating input**, and implement features like **filtering** and **searching**.
- The second course we go into **paging**, **sorting**, and **data shaping**, implementing **Hypermedia as the Engine of Application State** (HATEOAS) support, a**dvanced content negotiation**, and **caching** and **concurrency**.

**Note** : As a way for marking that I practiced the two courses mentioned above, last commits in both courses are tagged with _course1_ and _course2_ respectively.
