# CourseLibrary
My practice on **Building a RESTful API with ASP.NET Core 3** and **Implementing Advanced RESTful Concerns with ASP.NET Core 3** courses on Pluralsight (both authored by Kevin Dockx). Here, we follow the case of courses library for pirates (authors) and their courses where we interact with the API to get info (with constraints or not), add more authors/courses, update their details, and deleting them if we wanted.

- The first course covers fundamental REST APIs goals and topics i.e. interacting with our API and be concerned with idempotency and method safety, validating input, and implement features like filtering and searching.
- The second course we go into peging, sorting, and data shaping, implementing Hypermedia as the Engine of Application State (HATEOAS) support, advanced content negotiation, and caching and concurrency.

**Note** : As a way for marking that I practiced the two courses mentioned above, last commits in both course will be tagged.
